## 🚀 Projects  

### 🧪 Bharat Genome Database (BGDB) – [Visit Site](https://www.bharatgenomedatabase.org/)  
India’s first large-scale **national genomic repository**, developed under the **Sivasakthi Science Foundation**. BGDB is a platform for **biodiversity genomics, AMR surveillance, and comparative genomics**, supporting both researchers and students.  
- Built cloud-native pipelines on **AWS & Debian servers**.  
- Integrated genome annotation tools (Prokka, Roary, antiSMASH, GECCO).  
- Added visualization via **JBrowse2** & **Next.js dashboards**.  
- Expanding into **One Day One Genome (ODOG)** initiatives.  

---

### 🤖 GenAI Research Labs – [Visit Site](https://genairesearchlabs.org)  
A translational research hub for **AI-driven biology and healthcare applications**. The lab focuses on **AI models for genomics, diagnostics, and drug discovery**.  
- Internship projects:  
  - **NAFLD comorbidity prediction** using clinical & genomic data.  
  - **Gut microbiome & autoimmunity prediction models**.  
  - **AI-driven annotation pipelines** for microbial genomes.  
- Building **multi-modal AI agents** for research design, literature review, and predictive biology.  
- Currently experimenting with **vector databases (FAISS, Qdrant)** for semantic knowledge graphs.  

---

### 🌱 ArogyaSakthi – Translational & Industry Partnerships  
The **translational arm** of Sivasakthi Science Foundation, connecting **lab discoveries to industry**. Focus areas include:  
- **Technology transfer** of genomics & AI tools to biotech startups.  
- **Pilot projects** for molecular diagnostics & therapeutics.  
- **Collaborations** with hospitals, universities, and biotech firms.  
- Driving **bioeconomy growth** via real-world applications of genomics.  

---

### 🎓 Teaching & Learning Platforms  
As a **Teaching Assistant** for the graduate course *Comparative Genomics with AI and Cloud Computing*, I design modules blending **bioinformatics, cloud systems, and AI tools**.  
- Built **Streamlit & React-based study hubs** for embedding lecture videos, notes, and pipelines.  
- Created structured **two-month bioinformatics teaching plans** on AWS cloud, Linux, and pipelines.  
- Developed **student portals** to track progress, showcase projects, and foster collaboration.  

---

### 🧠 AI in Research & Experiment Design  
Part of my **PhD work** and broader research vision is to develop a **pluggable biomedical AI agent**:  
- **Multi-modal system**: integrates genomic sequences, biological protocols, experimental metadata, and images.  
- **Capabilities**:  
  - Literature review & hypothesis generation.  
  - Experimental protocol optimization.  
  - Predictive analytics for lab workflows.  
- Inspired by projects like **Biomni**, but customized for **Indian biomedical research ecosystems**.
